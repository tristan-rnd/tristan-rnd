- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @tristan-rnd
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in medical imaging, computer vision, machine learning, data science... Genereally speaking, wrapping medical imaging with computer sciences (have a look at my beautiful profil picture of a Purkinje cell found in our cerebellum ğŸ§ ).
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning imaging and technology for medicine at Physic and Engineering School, University of Clermont Auvergne.
